            <h2>Q&A with the Bybelgenootskap</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>1. Ask yourself this.</h3>
                <p>What are Rodney van Wyk and his associates currently engaged in? Are they using https://luminafrica.bible/ as a platform to misappropriate the intellectual property of the Bible Society of South Africa? Why is van Wyk not dedicating his efforts to managing and safeguarding the Bible Society as a business, instead of focusing on this Luminafrica initiative? Did Dirk Gevers orchestrate this transition prior to his move to UBS, leaving the organization in a precarious state? These are critical questions that need to be addressed.</p>

                <h3>2. Old -vs- New.</h3>
                <p>In the previous organizational structure, employees could report issues through the HR department. For example, if you had a problem with the head of finance, you could report it to the head of HR. However, in the proposed new structure, you would have to report this issue to the CFO. This creates a conflict of interest, as the head of finance will also serve as the head of HR. Essentially, you would be required to report the head of finance to themselves, making it impossible to address the issue effectively.  This is a clear example of an emerging dictatorship.</p>

                <h3>3. Path to the Future.</h3>
                <p>The only way to advance with this proposed structure is to either accept an authoritarian business model or take immediate action to eliminate the power of three individuals who can override every business decision to suit their own agenda and interests</p>

                <h3>4. Our engagement.</h3>
                <p>We are concerned former employees and members of the public who refuse to allow this business to proceed down a path of destruction. We are ready, capable, and resolutely determined.</p>

                <h3>5. Engagement with public figures.</h3>
                <p><li>Legal counsel has been informed, and everything stated herein is both legal and accurate.</li>
                   <li>The South African Council of Churches (SACC) will be notified, and all stakeholders will be engaged.</li>
                   <li>Authorities will be notified, and criminal proceedings will be initiated.</li>
                   <li>SAICA will not only be apprised of the aforementioned case but also kept informed of its resolution.</li></p>
